# House-Price-Prediction-using-Multiple-Linear-Regression-NumPy-Scikit-learn-
This project implements a house price prediction model using Multiple Linear Regression. The model predicts house prices based on two features: area (sqft) and number of bedrooms.  The project focuses on:  Understanding feature–coefficient relationships  Correct data shaping for multi-feature regression  Interpreting coefficients and intercept  
## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Model Details
The model follows the equation:

Price = w1 × Area + w2 × Bedrooms + b

## Key Learnings
- Coefficients depend on number of features, not data points
- Negative intercepts are valid in linear regression
- Regression problems do not have decision boundaries
- Importance of checking array shapes before training models

## Dataset
Synthetic dataset created for learning purposes.

## Status
Educational / learning project
